<div class="margin_borders"><p>My name is Ximena Tellez. My parents are from Jalisco Mexico. I am the first born and that means that I will be the first one to go to college from my siblings and I have to be a good role model for them. I was always taught to be more responsible and I've had to deal with a lot at a young age. </p>

	<p>I'm in this program because I plan to get a new experience. I like to do new things which I have such as dancing classes, performing, and even traveling all over jalisco. I don't know what I will do in the future but I hope that this class will help me somehow find out what my future job or what I will be interested it and like I always say "everything happens for a reason," so I like living my life and having fun because you don't know how much time you have left. In bad situations, just remember that it happened for a reason and at the end be happy it happened because you might get stronger from the situation. </p></div>
